# Welcome to MentorUp, team H's final project for SOC Bootcamp 6

MentorUp is a collective work created by the Dreamer team AKA Muna Fidow, Clarisse Leduc and Toby Smith.

MentorUp is an app that connects aspiring entrepreneurs to existing entrepreneurs so that they can mentored on their topic of need.
MentorUp aims to provide equal opportunities to access a mentor regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, accessibility needs.

## Our Brief

How can we help people to launch successful startup companies?

## Our Solution

We created MentorUp, this is a place where everyone has an equal chance to get a Mentor, without any bias. Users are able to sign up, pick what topics they need help with, along with other requirements such as a Language Translator. Then they will be automaticaly matched up with a Mentor based on their needs and if possible, the industry. Our goal was to make the app as accessable as possible, to allow anyone to be able to use it, and benifit from it.
